# CMSC420 Spring 22

Features:

* Easy ide integration. No playing with ur path, working directory, auto complete, etc.
* Use gradle to build
  * `gradle build`
* Tests converted to junit
  * run them with  `gradle test`
  * Better error messages
  * rerun failing tests, individual tests easily
* Automated submission
  *  `gradle submit` (uses `gradescope-submit` from 330)
  * You can use `gradescope-submit` directly as well

Downsides: Waiting on me to convert the projects (for example, I finished converting 1a today). I'll accept PR's helping out with this.
